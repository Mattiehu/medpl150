<h1>Homework 2</h1>
  <img src="image1.jpg" width="80%">

  <p>I chose these two images because they have many visual elements. They show buildings from different periods and styles, from older low-rise structures to modern tall ones. This mix of styles creates a strong visual effect and shows the growth of city architecture. The blue and purple tones give the images a special atmosphere. The differences in light and dark within these colors add a clear sense of depth. The buildings in the front, middle, and back form distinct layers. The viewer’s eyes move from the front to the back, as if walking along a city street and slowly discovering the city’s architecture.</p>
