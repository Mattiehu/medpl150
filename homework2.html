<h1>Homework 2</h1>
  <img src="image1.jpg" width="80%">

  <p>I chose these two images because they have many visual details. They show buildings from different times and styles, from old low ones to new tall ones. This mix of styles makes a strong visual effect and shows the changes in city architecture. The blue and purple colors make a special mood. The different lights and darks in these colors make the image look deeper. The small buildings in the front and the tall ones in the middle and back create clear layers. The viewerâ€™s eyes move from near to far, as if walking on a city street and seeing more of the buildings ahead.</p>
