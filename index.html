<h1>Mattie Hu</h1>

<p>My name is Mattie Hu, and I’m a Media Studies major at Hunter College.
I was born in a small city in southern China, where life moves slowly. Growing up in such a gentle rhythm taught me to be deeply curious about everything that stands out around me — because time allowed me to truly observe.

My senses are divided into two: seeing and hearing.
Through sight, I take in everything — from the vastness of the sky, the sea, and tall buildings, to the smallest things like flowers by the street, stray cats, or even ants. Each becomes something to behold, something that makes me reflect on the meaning of life. To me, capturing moments through a camera can never compare to observing them with my eyes and feeling them with my heart.
Through hearing, I listen — to the sound of rain, wind, and thunder in autumn and winter; to the rustling of falling leaves; to the cicadas singing in the trees during spring and summer; to the laughter of people playing outside; to the voices of my loved ones through the phone; and to the songs of my favorite artists in my headphones.

In the end, I find myself wondering — aren’t all these things a kind of “art” within life itself?</p>
