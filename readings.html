<h2>Susan sontag's photography</h2>
  <p>After reading Susan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave,” I have a new idea about what it means to “see.” She compares photographs to shadows in Plato’s cave. I think this fits our world today. We often think we are looking at real life, but we are really just looking at its “images.” People today are around many photos and videos. The real part of life seems smaller. We see pictures of places, people, and events every day, but we do not really feel them.

I have always liked taking pictures with my phone. When I see something beautiful, my first thought is to take a photo. I do not stop to feel the moment. After reading this essay, I started to think if I am living in the “cave” that Sontag talks about. She says photography gives a feeling of control. We think we can “catch” time and the world with the camera. But really, we are more distant from it. When I take photos, I look for the right angle or press the button. I forget to enjoy the moment itself.

Reading this also made me notice that people today are tied to cameras and phones. Many do not experience the world with their eyes. A good example is at concerts. How many people watch the show with their eyes and feel every moment of their favorite singer? Most hold up their phones or cameras. Some do it for a short time. Some do it for the whole show. On social media, people say, “Photos and videos in my phone are the only proof I saw you.” I think it is more important to enjoy the moment. Many focus on recording and forget to see.

Sontag also says photos can make people aware and numb. We may feel sad when we see pain or tragedy. After seeing too many, we stop feeling anything. This spoke to me. I do the same. When I scroll news about disasters, I sigh and move on. I do not think deeply. Sontag made me see that this kind of “seeing” is a way to escape. We try to get close to the world with images. At the same time, we keep ourselves apart.

I also noticed that photography changes how we remember things. We take many pictures to look back later. Sometimes we feel that without a photo, the memory will disappear. But I think we forget that our mind can hold feelings and moments without a camera. Photos can keep a memory, but they cannot replace the feeling of being there.

What I like most is that Sontag does not say photography is good or bad. She asks us to think about seeing itself. For me, “seeing” is not only with eyes. It is also with the heart. Now I try to put my phone down. I just look and listen. Being present feels more real than any photo I can take. I notice the small things. I hear sounds I usually ignore. I feel the light and colors around me. These moments are real. They cannot be captured fully in a photo.

  <h3>Nesrine Malik“With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster”</h3>
  <p>In her article “‘With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster” Nesrine Malik talks about how generative AI changes the way we see things, use media, and understand the world. She calls some content “AI Slop.” This means many low-quality and cheap images made by machines. These images look strange or political. Some are fun to look at, but they do not teach anything. Malik says this content is not only annoying, but also dangerous. It changes the way people understand the world. It also makes it harder to know what is real.

Malik says AI slop creates a second visual reality. This reality is hard to tell apart from the real world, especially on social media. The systems that show these images do not know what is true or false. They do not know what is a joke or what is propaganda. They only show content that makes people look at it or click. So shocking AI images spread very fast. At the same time, careful reporting with facts is ignored. The platforms that show this content benefit. Cheap machine-made images save money. They also keep people scrolling, even if people start to trust what they see less.

She also says these images carry ideas and values. Many of them show old-fashioned or backward values. They show white families in traditional roles. They show women mainly taking care of the home. They show general ideas about “tradition” that match conservative thinking. These biases are not made on purpose. They come from the information used to teach AI. The information itself already has unfair ideas and cultural stereotypes. AI repeats these values. It also makes them seem new or fun when it shares them again.

Malik explains that AI slop is not only on public websites. It is also in private spaces. It spreads in WhatsApp groups, Telegram chats, and other closed digital spaces. In these spaces, people rarely check facts. People trust the sender, so they accept the images quickly. Over time, all this content can confuse people. It can make them tired or not care. People cannot tell what is real and what is made by machines. They start to separate from politics and society.

Malik makes her point strong because she says AI slop is not just a problem in the future. It is already part of daily life. People see these images every day. They share them without thinking. They accept the ideas in them without question. The content changes how people look at the world. It also changes how people trust what they see. People see more images from machines, and less from careful reporting.

This article helps readers understand that AI slop is everywhere. It is in social media, messaging apps, and websites. It is cheap, easy to make, and often fun to look at. It also carries old ideas and shows biased values. It spreads quickly, and people do not always know what is true. The problem is not only the images. The problem is how these images change the way people think and feel. They can make people less aware of reality and less careful about truth.</p>
