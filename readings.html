<h2>Susan sontag's photography</h2>
  <p>After reading Susan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave,” I have a new idea about what it means to “see.” She compares photographs to shadows in Plato’s cave. I think this fits our world today. We often think we are looking at real life, but we are really just looking at its “images.” People today are around many photos and videos. The real part of life seems smaller. We see pictures of places, people, and events every day, but we do not really feel them.

I have always liked taking pictures with my phone. When I see something beautiful, my first thought is to take a photo. I do not stop to feel the moment. After reading this essay, I started to think if I am living in the “cave” that Sontag talks about. She says photography gives a feeling of control. We think we can “catch” time and the world with the camera. But really, we are more distant from it. When I take photos, I look for the right angle or press the button. I forget to enjoy the moment itself.

Reading this also made me notice that people today are tied to cameras and phones. Many do not experience the world with their eyes. A good example is at concerts. How many people watch the show with their eyes and feel every moment of their favorite singer? Most hold up their phones or cameras. Some do it for a short time. Some do it for the whole show. On social media, people say, “Photos and videos in my phone are the only proof I saw you.” I think it is more important to enjoy the moment. Many focus on recording and forget to see.

Sontag also says photos can make people aware and numb. We may feel sad when we see pain or tragedy. After seeing too many, we stop feeling anything. This spoke to me. I do the same. When I scroll news about disasters, I sigh and move on. I do not think deeply. Sontag made me see that this kind of “seeing” is a way to escape. We try to get close to the world with images. At the same time, we keep ourselves apart.

I also noticed that photography changes how we remember things. We take many pictures to look back later. Sometimes we feel that without a photo, the memory will disappear. But I think we forget that our mind can hold feelings and moments without a camera. Photos can keep a memory, but they cannot replace the feeling of being there.

What I like most is that Sontag does not say photography is good or bad. She asks us to think about seeing itself. For me, “seeing” is not only with eyes. It is also with the heart. Now I try to put my phone down. I just look and listen. Being present feels more real than any photo I can take. I notice the small things. I hear sounds I usually ignore. I feel the light and colors around me. These moments are real. They cannot be captured fully in a photo.
